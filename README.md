# Prodict



So far everything here was created by me in Python
I have created a basic prototype gui to apply for the production API key. 
Also I have prepared couple of data gathering scripts from riot api, but a bigger request limit is necessary to gather more data for training.
Did not want to webscrape as it is not a good long term solution.
