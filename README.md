# Prodict



So far everything here was created by me in Python
I have prepared couple of data gathering scripts from riot api, but a bigger request limit is necessary to gather more data for training.
Did not want to webscrape as it is not a good long term solution.
To 'solve' the problem of predicting an outcome of a game before the game starts requires a lot of data, not only about each champion but also each player.

So far data_gathering only gets information about champion ids. More information about players is required to have a solid prediction algorithm.

GUI_2.py is the window where the gui is run
client_info has functions that are used in GUI_2.py. It can check if client is open, if you are in champion select, or what champions your team picked.
The application is deffinitely not complete yet, but to create an MVP(Minimum viable product) more data is needed. That is why data gathering is the bottleneck in this project.
Thats why I would like to get access to production key before spending more time on the app.
